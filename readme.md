# My First Project

## What is this project?
This project is my first real attempt at a program which integrates python 
using libraries such as OAuth, Psycopg2, Flask, and more to retrieve Twitter 
post information(logged in under a particular user), and store said user in 
postgreSQL.

## Will this be posted anywhere for easier access?
**Yes!** I will, likely after completion, post this in a subdirectory of my 
personal domain which is hosting my portfolio: www.coltonmarschik.com

## Do I think this code is good?
I don't know. This, as stated above, is my first attempt at a major project(by 
my standard) so I am sure this will act not as a brilliant work, but rather as a foundation to revisit as I learn and grow beyond this foundation.

## What are the requirements to run this project? 
This project uses postgreSQL 9.5, pgadmin3, and python3.6. All required
libraries are listed in the "requirements.txt" file.
