# My First Project

## What is this project?
This project is my first real attempt at a program which integrates python 
using libraries such as OAuth, Psycopg2, Flask, and more to retrieve Twitter 
post information(logged in under a particular user), and store said user in 
postgreSQL.

## Will this be posted anywhere for easier access?
**Yes!** This directory is hyperlinked on my portfolio; it is being hosted here: www.coltonmarschik.com

## Do I think this code is good?
I don't know. This, as stated above, is my first attempt at a major project(by 
my standard) so I am sure this will act not as a brilliant work, but rather as a foundation to revisit as I learn and grow beyond this foundation.

## What were my project requirements?
This project uses postgreSQL 9.5, pgadmin3, and python3.6. All required
libraries are listed in the "requirements.txt" file.

### Why doesn't this work for the reader?
Simply put pieces are missing. For example, a CONSUMER KEY & CONSUMER SECRET are required to use this. Similar 'problems' occur when trying to access my private server through postgreSQL. Also, this project was originally set to use Facebook API, but I changed my mind, so the naming, and really, pathing may not be 
functional. The point of this project is not to present a beautifully working app, but rather to give insight into my knowledge of python and associated libraries. All of my important code should be up and readable.

### This code looks familiar?
I had heavy influence from an online class I took. Although this is not neccessarily the original code presented, in my process of making the same app work the same way, my code differed little(not to mention I went back to reference it quite heavily). So I shall link the course here:
